# Resistor Calculator
This app has two functions:
- Calculate resistor value using band colours
- Show band colours corresponding inputted resistance


The calculator contains inputs for three-, four-, five-, and six-band resistors on one window. 

This app was made during my spare time. Thank you for inspecting!
