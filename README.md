# Resistor Calculator
This app is a work in progress and will ultimately have two functions:
- Calculate resistor value using band colours (working)
- Show band colours for corresponding inputted resistance (in progress)


The calculator contains inputs for three-, four-, five-, and six-band resistors on one window. 

This app is being made during my spare time. Thank you for inspecting!
